# Interactive File Hash Calculator

---

## üöÄ Overview

This Bash script provides an interactive way to calculate various cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512) for any specified file. It's designed to be user-friendly, prompting you for the file path and then displaying all calculated hashes in a clear, organized format. This can be super handy for verifying file integrity or checking for tampering.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Input:** Easily provide the file path when prompted.
* **Multiple Hash Algorithms:** Calculates MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 hashes.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Linux and within Bash environments on Windows (like Git Bash or WSL).
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles non-existent files or incorrect paths.
* **User-Friendly Output:** Displays hashes clearly for quick verification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run this script, you'll need:

* **Bash:** A Unix-like shell (standard on Linux, available via Git Bash or WSL on Windows).
* **Core Utilities:** The `md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `sha256sum`, and `sha512sum` commands. These are typically part of `coreutils` on Linux and are included with Git Bash and WSL.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1.  **Save the Script:**
    Save the script content (e.g., from the `hash_calculator.sh` file) into a file named `hash_calculator.sh` in your desired directory.

2.  **Make it Executable:**
    Open your terminal (or Git Bash/WSL terminal on Windows) and run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x hash_calculator.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./hash_calculator.sh
    ```

4.  **Enter File Path:**
    The script will prompt you to "Enter the full path to the file".
    * **Linux:** Provide the standard Linux path (e.g., `/home/user/documents/my_file.zip`).
    * **Windows (Git Bash/WSL):** Use forward slashes (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/Documents/my_file.zip` or `/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/my_file.zip` for WSL).
    * Type `exit` to quit the script at any time.

## üåê Compatibility Notes for Windows Users

This Bash script requires a Bash environment to run on Windows. You have two excellent options:

### Option 1: Git Bash (Recommended for most)

* **Install Git for Windows:** This package includes Git Bash, a powerful command-line environment that provides a Unix-like shell and essential utilities (including the `*sum` commands needed by this script). You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
* Once installed, launch "Git Bash" from your Start Menu and follow the "How to Use" steps above.

### Option 2: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

* **Install WSL:** If you prefer a full Linux environment within Windows, follow Microsoft's official guide to install WSL and your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
* Open your WSL terminal, navigate to your files (Windows drives are usually mounted under `/mnt/`), and follow the "How to Use" steps.
